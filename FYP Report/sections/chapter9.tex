\chapter{Iteration 4}
\label{ch:iter4}
In our fourth iteration of the MetaMed VR project, we aim to enhance the user experience by integrating Keyboard and Meta Quest 2 functionalities seamlessly. The Keyboard offers familiar input methods for typing medical notes and interacting with virtual objects, while Meta Quest 2 provides advanced hand tracking and gesture recognition for natural interaction within the virtual environment. By combining these strengths, we aim to elevate immersion and realism in MetaMed VR, enhancing educational value and enabling innovative training scenarios. This iteration marks a significant step forward in our mission to provide effective training tools for healthcare professionals using immersive technology.
